# 🛠️ Compilation Guide

This guide helps resolve common Unity compilation issues in the Polygon Board Game project.

## ✅ Quick Fix Checklist

### 1. **Unity Version**
- **Required**: Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer
- **Recommended**: Unity 2021.3.33f1 or later
- Download from: [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)

### 2. **Project Opening**
1. Open Unity Hub
2. Click "Open" and select the `PolygonBoardGame` folder
3. Unity will automatically import and configure the project

### 3. **Asset Refresh**
If you see missing script references:
1. Go to `Assets` → `Refresh` (or press Ctrl+R)
2. Wait for Unity to re-import all assets
3. Check the Console for any remaining errors

### 4. **Script Compilation**
If scripts don't compile:
1. Go to `Assets` → `Reimport All`
2. Wait for Unity to recompile all scripts
3. If errors persist, check the [Common Issues](#common-issues) section

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: "The type or namespace name 'Unity.Netcode' could not be found"**
**Solution**: This is already fixed in the latest version. The NetworkManager now uses a simplified system without external dependencies.

### **Issue: Missing Script References**
**Solution**: 
1. Select the GameObject with missing scripts
2. Click the "Missing Script" component
3. Drag the correct script from the Project window
4. Common scripts location: `Assets/Scripts/`

### **Issue: GUID Conflicts**
**Solution**:
1. Close Unity
2. Delete the `Library` folder in the project directory
3. Reopen Unity - it will regenerate the Library folder

### **Issue: Package Manager Errors**
**Solution**:
1. Open `Window` → `Package Manager`
2. Click the refresh button (⟳)
3. If packages are missing, they'll be automatically downloaded

### **Issue: Scene Loading Errors**
**Solution**:
1. Go to `File` → `Build Settings`
2. Add `Assets/Scenes/MainGame.unity` to the build
3. Set it as the active scene

## 🎮 Testing the Game

### **Play Mode Testing**
1. Open `Assets/Scenes/MainGame.unity`
2. Click the Play button (▶️)
3. The game should start without errors

### **Build Testing**
1. Go to `File` → `Build Settings`
2. Select your target platform
3. Click "Build and Run"

## 🔄 Troubleshooting Steps

### **If the game doesn't start:**
1. Check Unity Console for errors
2. Ensure all GameObjects have proper script references
3. Verify the GameSetup script is attached to a GameObject

### **If networking features don't work:**
The project uses a simplified networking system that works locally. For true multiplayer:
1. Install Unity Netcode for GameObjects via Package Manager
2. Restore the original NetworkManager implementation
3. Configure network settings in the NetworkManager component

### **If achievements don't track:**
1. Check that the AchievementSystem is in the scene
2. Verify event connections in GameManager
3. Test with simple achievements first
